Game title: Jerry's Cheese Chase,
https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-373591

Description: This little game showcases Jerry's race to get all the pieces of cheese to live, With the exciting setting of a common kitchen there are plenty of obstacles to block Jerry on his path to freedom. Using Unity's engine and C# scripts we created a little game where Jerry can dash around and pick up pieces of cheese, all while avoiding traps.
